# ml2017hd
Will contain the code for our project in "Fundamentals of Machine Learning"

# Versions
|Nr.|Main Changes|
|---|---|
|v0|Basic architecture. CPU. MAE. Input: 224x224. "rater-first-attempt.ipynb".|
|v1|Same architecture. GPU. Categorical crossentropy, 6 classes. Input: 100x100. L2 regularizer, lr=0.0001.|
|v2|Tried training model generated by Hyperparameter Search (`opt_classifierv0`). Input: 200x200. Bad results.|
|v3|Data augmentation & streaming. Round ratings to integers (stars). Input: 200x200.|
|v3.1|Same architecture as v3, includes prediction output for human supervision (like v4.1).|
|v3.2|Same architecture as v3, no dropout after feature extraction. WORKS: val_loss: 1.5996 - val_acc: 0.3391 (see `rater-v3.2-2nd`).|
|v3.2.1|Same setup as v3.2, but 1 layer deeper. Improvement of val_acc: 0.4087.|
|v3.2.1.1|Same as v3.2.1, but 1 layer deeper. No improvement.|
|v3.2.1.2|Same as v3.2.1, but twice as wide. No improvement.|
|v3.2.1.3|Same as v3.2.1, but using only 10% of data for test set. Improvement: val_acc: 0.5000.|
|v3.2.1.4|Same as v3.2.1, but using only 5% of data for test set. Improvement: val_acc: 0.8714.|
|v3.2.2|Same setup as v3.2, but twice as wide. No improvement.|
|v4|Expanding on regression approach of v0. Data augmentation. No Dropout after feature extraction.|
|v4.1|Uses clipped ReLU to get results between 0 and 5. Predictions tend to extremes. No Dropout after feature extraction.|
|v4.2|Wider (512) first fc-layer, narrower (8) last fc-layer. Clipped ReLU. No Dropout after feature extraction.|
|v5|Remodelled. Architecture of v3.2.1. Recommendation.|
|v5.1|Weighted crossentropy loss.|
|v6|Ordinal Regression.|
|v6.1|Ordinal Regression + categorical_accuracy metric. Fail.|
|v6.2|Ordinal Regression + squared_error loss. Fail.|
|v6.3|Attempt at weighted binary_crossentropy.|
|v7|KNN Classifier|
|v8|Voting Ensemble - failed because sklearn does not support multiple labels per prediction.|

**Best model currently: ~~v3.2.1.4~~ At this point it's not exactly clear anymore.**
